# BudgetLoan
BudgetLoan is a mobile app developer for ShellHacks 2020. That helps you manage your budget while saving you extra money to help pay off your student loan or any other loan.

## How It Works
BudgetLoan works by have the user add their reoccuring bills, income, and their due dates. The rest of the budgeting is handled by adding transactions. Everytime a user receives money, it splits the income between bills and spending money, and everytime the user spends money, the app will round up to the nearest dollar. That extra change will go to a pool of savings that will be used to help make addition payments on the user's student loans!

## Cool Things We Learned
**ItsOnlyCole:** "Some things I got to learn were how to use Flutter and SQLite; two technologies I've been wanting to learn leading up to ShellHacks '20. At the start of the hackathon, I quickly realized my Emacs config wouldn't work with Flutter as the Flutter packages caused Emacs to slow to a crawl and occasionally freeze. So I also ended up learning how to extend Vim and quickly switched to used that to develop on this weekend, and overall, I was extremely impressed with it!"
